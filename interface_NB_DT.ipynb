    "This notebook introduces an online simulation-based digital twin developed for the Nibelungenbrücke bridge. The orchestration system is designed to interact dynamically with the user by gathering key inputs; such as time, physical parameters, and spatial positions to perform real-time simulations of the bridge structure.\n",
